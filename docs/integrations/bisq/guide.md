    Fortunately, you already run a soverign Bitcoin node on your Start9 server, so you can proceed confidently.  Click "OK"

1. At this point you should see that Bisq is syncing with your Bitcoin node in the very bottom left of the application window.  If you do not see this, make sure you have selected "Use Custom Bitcoin Core Node" and restart Bisq again.

    That's it!  You're synced and ready to use Bisq with your own Bitcoin node on Start9 server!!
