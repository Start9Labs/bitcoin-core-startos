# Bitcoin Core

## Getting Started

### Config

Your node is highly configurable. Many settings are considered _advanced_ and should be used with caution. For the vast majority of users and use-cases, we recommend using the defaults. This is where you can change RPC credentials as well. Once configured, you may start your node!

### Syncing

Depending on your hardware resources, internet bandwidth, how many other services are running, and what peers your node happens to connect to, your node should take anywhere from under a day to several days to sync from genesis to present.

## Pruning

Beginning with version **25.0.0.1**, pruning is now handled automatically depending on the available space. If there is insufficient free space, pruning will be automatically configured. Users also have the option to adjust pruning settings manually.

Pruning is a process by which your node discards old blocks and transactions after it verifies them. Pruned nodes and archival nodes are both "full nodes" in that they are fully validating - they validate every block and transaction. Archival nodes store the entire blockchain and are useful to people interested in doing general or historical analysis, or being a provider of blockchain data to others (eg. a blockexplorer). They are also required for the best experience with many popular wallets and other Bitcoin tools.

**If you choose to prune**, the target on your Start9 server is configurable and set by default to the minimum of 550MB (0.55 GB!), meaning the resulting blockchain will occupy a negligible amount of storage space. The maximum amount of blockchain data you can retain depends on the storage capacity your device. The config menu will not permit you to select a target that exceeds a certain percentage of your device's available capacity.  For most use cases, we recommend sticking with a very low pruning setting.

## Backups

When your server backs up this service, it will *not* include the blocks, chainstate, or indexes, so you don't need to worry about it eating your backup drive if you run an archival node.

## Using a Wallet

Enter your QuickConnect QR code **OR** your raw RPC credentials (both located in `Properties`) into any wallet that supports connecting to a remote node over Tor. For a full list of compatible wallets, as well as guides for setup, please see the [documentation](https://docs.start9.com/latest/service-guides/bitcoin/bitcoin-integrations).
